# Plant Pathology Web App

A simple web app for my [plant pathology classifier](https://github.com/bwolfson97/plant_pathology) created using [Streamlit](https://streamlit.io/) and deployed with [Heroku](https://www.heroku.com/). 
Thanks for checking it out!

Shoutout to Vladimir Iglovikov's excellent [tutorial](https://ternaus.blog/tutorial/2020/08/28/Trained-model-what-is-next.html) for helping me create this.

Note: it may take a few minutes to load.
